## PURPOSE

The aim of this project was to identify relevant genes within the disease-specific interactome for degenerative diseases of nervous system, and evaluate computational tools for predicting putative disease genes. The programming language used is Python.

## REPOSITORY AND FILES

The repositories and the files are:
- **files**: it contains the files read and used for the project.
- `BNM_proj_group_7.ipynb`: contains the code for the analysis and the implementation of the network model.
- `BNM_proj_group_7.pdf`: contains the report with the interpretation and the explanations of the results.
